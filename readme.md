## PetiteDrv
This project is extends from wujique/stm32f407。
The program architecture is not significantly different。
Only modified the directory structure for better portability。
Now, PetiteDrv is port to WUJIQUE(STM32F407) and Canary(STM32F103).
It will port to more chip in the future, E.g FSL MK60, K210, ESP32, RT1052...
